# Loki
C++, GameAI

My plan:
1. hook up a C++ game skeleton
2. write a FSM
3. write a behavior tree
4. write my own shitty AI system
5. 2D first, then 3D
6. weak gameplay, AI is the hero in this project
7. storyline base on my previous game project

2019/2/24 lixuechi:
maybe kill 1 to 7 and improvise
